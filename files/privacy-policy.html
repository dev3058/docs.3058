          <h2 class="mb-3"  style="font-family: Quicksand;">Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</h2>
          <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</p>
<p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
<p>0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;</p>
<p>0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our website;</p>
<p>0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;</p>
<p>0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at <b><a href="mailto:mail@3058.in"> mail@3058.in</a></b>.</p>
<p>Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:</p>
<p>We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.</p>
<p>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-3"  style="font-family: Quicksand;">Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</h2>
          <p>If you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your data and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make certain requests and ask us:</p>
<p><b>0.1. What personal information we have about you. If you make this request, we will return to you:</b></p>
<p>0.0.1. The categories of personal information we have collected about you.</p>
<p>0.0.2. The categories of sources from which we collect your personal information.</p>
<p>0.0.3. The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.</p>
<p>0.0.4. The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information.</p>
<p>0.0.5. The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.</p>
<p>0.0.6. A list of categories of personal information that we have sold, along with the category of any other company we sold it to. If we have not sold your personal information, we will inform you of that fact.</p>
<p>0.0.7. A list of categories of personal information that we have disclosed for a business purpose, along with the category of any other company we shared it with.</p>
<p>Please note, you are entitled to ask us to provide you with this information up to two times in a rolling twelve-month period. When you make this request, the information provided may be limited to the personal information we collected about you in the previous 12 months.</p>
<p><b>0.2. To delete your personal information. If you make this request, we will delete the personal information we hold about you as of the date of your request from our records and direct any service providers to do the same. In some cases, deletion may be accomplished through de-identification of the information. If you choose to delete your personal information, you may not be able to use certain functions that require your personal information to operate.</b></p>
<p><b>0.3. To stop selling your personal information. We don’t sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. However, under some circumstances, a transfer of personal information to a third party, or within our family of companies, without monetary consideration may be considered a “sale” under California law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.</b></p>
<p>If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers.</p>
<p>Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances, we will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.</p>
<p>To exercise your California data protection rights described above, please send your request(s) by email: <b><a href="mailto:mail@3058.in"> mail@3058.in</a></b>.</p>
